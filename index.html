    <h2 id="freedom">Freedom</h2>
    <p>The definition of freedom is the infinite value of the human being. The definition of evil is the destruction of
      freedom. Everything that is evil teaches people that they have limited value.</p>
    <h2 id="simple">Simple</h2>
    <p>Truth is always simple. All people recognize truth because all people are intelligent beings. It is the nature of
      evil to create artificially complex ideas. It does this to hide or obfuscate the freedom it destroys. If you
      remove
      the complexities and fears from your life you will find a plain and beautiful truth. This truth is the nature of
      your
      worth.</p>
    <h2 id="value-of-man">Value of man</h2>
    <p>To understand freedom is to understand the value of a person. Everything that evil wants is to disguise and
      destroy
      your value. All authority is created by evil men to disguise your worth. To understand your own worth is to
      understand
      the nature of liberty.</p>
    <h2 id="evil">Evil</h2>
    <p>The crucial key for understanding our world is to understand the nature of evil. Evil challenges the value of
      people
      by denying them the opportunity to make their own choices; by denying them the chance to grow strong in learning
      and
      understanding.</p>
    <h2 id="freedom_1">Freedom</h2>
    <p>While evil seeks to destroy or hide a person's worth, freedom shows humans their full potential and their full
      value.
      With freedom, people have loved, cured disease, removed hunger, eased labor and lived in peace. With freedom,
      happiness is possible. Freedom is the exact opposite of evil.</p>
    <h2 id="you">You</h2>
    <p>Everything written in this book is written to destroy the ideas of culture and law. The lesson of this book is
      simple: nothing on earth is more valuable than you.</p>
